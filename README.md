Ru studios is a website containing two games; a rock paper scissors game where a player competes against a computer character called the "Ru-bot" and a Love calculator game called Love Doctor and some photoshop special effects I made.

More about Ru-bot
Ru-bot derives it's name from my name "Ruro's bot" shortened to "Ru-bot". In the game, typical rock,paper, scissors rules apply. The first player to get to a score of 10 is the winner. 
After a player win's or loses they see a gif. image of me sulking if the player beats the Ru-bot or a gif. of me mocking the player if the Ru-bot beats the player. Some text also accompany's the gif image.

More about Love Doctor
Love Doctor is similar to most love calculators which require a user to enter two names and gives a report sheet with an advise based on the percentages calculated by the programme.
Unlike most love calculators, I created my own algorithm which gives a wide range of computed percentage adding more fun to the user experience.
